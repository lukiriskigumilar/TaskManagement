# Task Management App

This is a simple **Task Management** or **To-Do List** application built using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app was developed as part of the **JavaScript Basics** module in the Harisenin.com Bootcamp.

## Features

- **Task Prioritization**:
  - Tasks can be assigned one of three priority levels: **High**, **Medium**, or **Low**.
  - Each priority level is visually distinguished by color.
  
- **Responsive Design**:
  - The application is designed to work seamlessly on all screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
  
- **Deadline Countdown**:
  - The app automatically calculates and displays a countdown to the task's deadline.
  
- **Overdue Tasks**:
  - Tasks that exceed their deadline are automatically updated with an "Task Deadline Missed" status.
  
- **Dynamic Color Coding**:
  - Task cards are color-coded based on their priority level for better visibility and organization.
